# Micro-Payments Platform

## Project Description

The Micro-Payments Platform is a decentralized smart contract system that enables seamless micro-transactions for digital content consumption. Built on blockchain technology, this platform allows content creators to monetize their digital assets (articles, music, videos, documents) through small, instant payments without the need for traditional payment processors or intermediaries.

The platform facilitates direct peer-to-peer transactions between content consumers and creators, ensuring transparent, secure, and cost-effective micro-payments. Users can pay small amounts to access premium content, while creators receive instant compensation for their work.
